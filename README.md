# RiceLoader 🍚
RiceLoader is a lightweight, self-configured model loader designed to simplify rendering 3D .obj models. This project is in its early stages but already supports basic features like loading vertices, texture coordinates, and normals from .obj files and rendering them using OpenGL.

# Features ✨
Loads .obj files: Reads vertex positions, texture coordinates, and normals.
Renders models: Displays 3D models with basic transformations and a simple camera view.
Self-contained: Lightweight and easy to integrate into your projects.
🚧 Work in Progress (WIP)
Material Support: Integration of .mtl files for advanced material rendering.
Enhanced Face Processing: Optimized handling for complex model data.
Texture Mapping: Currently under development.

# 🖼️ Example Output
RiceLoader renders .obj models with basic transformations like rotation:
